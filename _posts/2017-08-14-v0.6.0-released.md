QuickFIX/Go will be released subject to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).  Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable, however, we do not expect any *major* world breaking changes should you decide to start writing apps with QuickFIX/Go.
